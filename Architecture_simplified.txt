Architecture

Components:

Paper Fetcher:

Searches arXiv for relevant papers.
Falls back to web search (Serper) if no papers are found.
Summarizer:

Summarizes each paper’s abstract into structured findings (summary, findings, themes, data, surprises, implications).
Evaluator:

Assesses each summary for reliability, methodology, and quality (scores 0-1).
Synthesizer:

Combines all summaries and evaluations into a single, concise report, highlighting findings and analysis.
Document Drafter:

Drafts a research document in IMRaD format based on the synthesized report.
User Interface:

Streamlit app for user input, displaying results, and downloading the final document.
4. Workflow Breakdown

User Input:

User enters a research query.
Paper Retrieval:

The app searches arXiv for relevant papers.
If no papers are found, it uses a web search as a fallback.
Summarization:

Each paper’s abstract is summarized into a structured format.
Evaluation:

Each summary is evaluated for reliability, methodology, and quality.
Synthesis:

All summaries and evaluations are synthesized into a single report, with findings and analysis.
Document Drafting:

The synthesized report is used to draft a research document in IMRaD format.
Output:

The app displays all results and allows the user to download the drafted document.
5. Assumptions

The user provides valid API keys for Gemini and Serper.
arXiv and Serper APIs are accessible and responsive.
The Gemini API is used for summarization, evaluation, synthesis, and drafting.
Only abstracts are summarized, not full papers.
All citations in the final document are marked as "Synthesized data".
The user is responsible for reviewing and editing the final document for publication.
6. Further Improvement Report

Error Handling:
Add more robust error handling for API failures, timeouts, and rate limits.

Citation Enhancement:
Support real citation formats (APA, MLA, etc.) and link to original sources.

User Controls:
Allow users to select the number of papers, filter by year, or choose specific sources.

Caching:
Implement caching for repeated queries to reduce API usage and speed up results.

Evaluation Metrics:
Expand evaluation to include factual accuracy, novelty, and relevance.

Model Flexibility:
Allow users to choose between different summarization and drafting models.

UI Improvements:
Add progress bars, better error messages, and more interactive features.

Export Options:
Support exporting to PDF, DOCX, or LaTeX formats.

Feedback Loop:
Allow users to rate summaries and drafts to improve future results.


Modules and Functions:

search_papers: Searches arXiv for papers; falls back to Serper web search if needed. Extracts titles, authors, abstracts, and URLs from responses.
summarize: Uses Gemini API to create JSON summaries of abstracts, with fallbacks if parsing fails.
evaluate: Uses Gemini API to score summaries for reliability, methodology, and quality, returning JSON or default values if parsing fails.
synthesize: Combines summaries and evaluations into a report using Gemini, with fallbacks for empty responses.
draft: Generates an academic paper from the report using Gemini, with fallbacks for empty responses.
main: Runs the Streamlit app, chaining functions and displaying results with a download option
